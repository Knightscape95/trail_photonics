### 🚦 BREAKING CHANGES

#### Changed

- **CLI Interface**: Old monolithic execution replaced with modular commands
  ```bash
  # Old (removed)
  python revolutionary_execution_engine.py
  
  # New (modular)  
  python modular_cli.py full              # Complete pipeline
  python modular_cli.py dataset           # Dataset generation only
  python modular_cli.py meep              # MEEP validation only
  ```

- **Import Structure**: All imports now use graceful degradation
  ```python
  # Old (fatal on missing)
  import meep as mp  # Hard crash if missing
  
  # New (graceful)
  from graceful_imports import get_safe_meep
  meep = get_safe_meep()  # Mock if unavailable
  ```

- **Random Seeding**: Global seed management required
  ```python
  # Old (scattered, non-deterministic)
  np.random.seed(int(time.time()*1000) % 2**32)
  
  # New (centralized, deterministic)
  from seed_manager import seed_everything
  seed_everything(42)  # Sets all RNGs consistently
  ```
