### ‚úÖ 1. Exact Interaction Hamiltonian from Eq.(9)

**Implementation Location**: `rigorous_floquet_engine.py` - method `_exact_interaction_hamiltonian_eq9()`

**What was implemented**:

- Proper wave function overlaps and spatial discretization

### ‚úÖ 2. Propagation of Renormalization Constants Z‚ÇÅ, Z‚ÇÇ, Z‚ÇÉ

**Implementation Locations**: 
- `renormalisation.py` - Z constant calculations

- **Z‚ÇÇ**: Magnetic field renormalization (Z‚ÇÇ = Z‚ÇÅ) from Eq.(26b)  
- **Z‚ÇÉ**: Time-varying susceptibility renormalization from Eq.(26c)
- Dynamic updates throughout numerical routines based on energy scale
- Real-time convergence tracking with machine precision tolerance (1e-15)

**Key Features**:
- Constants calculated using minimal subtraction scheme
- Proper UV regularization with physical cutoff scales
- Propagation through every Hamiltonian calculation step
- Convergence monitoring with error bounds
- Perturbative regime validation (all constants ‚âà 1)

### ‚úÖ 3. Auto-Generation of Convergence Plots

**Implementation Location**: `rigorous_floquet_engine.py` - multiple plotting methods

**What was implemented**:
- Individual convergence plots for Z‚ÇÅ, Z‚ÇÇ, Z‚ÇÉ showing error vs iteration
- Machine precision reference lines (1e-15)
- Summary plot with all constants and convergence status
- Publication-quality formatting with proper legends and annotations
- Convergence analysis report generation
