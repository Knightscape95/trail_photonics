IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
------------------------------

1. EXACT INTERACTION HAMILTONIAN FROM EQ.(9):
   ✓ Implemented: Ĥ_int,I(t) = -ε₀/2 ∫d³r δχ(r,t) Ê²_I(r,t)
   ✓ Includes proper renormalization with Z₁ and Z₃ factors
   ✓ Maintains gauge independence and Hermiticity
   ✓ Uses interaction picture field operators
   ✓ Proper spatial integration with volume elements

2. RENORMALIZATION CONSTANTS PROPAGATION:
   ✓ Z₁ (electric field renormalization) propagated through all routines
   ✓ Z₂ (magnetic field renormalization) = Z₁ (electromagnetic duality)
   ✓ Z₃ (susceptibility renormalization) handles time-varying terms
   ✓ Constants updated dynamically based on energy scale
   ✓ Convergence tracking with machine precision tolerance

3. AUTO-GENERATION OF CONVERGENCE PLOTS:
   ✓ Individual Z₁, Z₂, Z₃ convergence error plots
   ✓ Summary plot with all constants and convergence status
   ✓ Machine precision reference lines (1e-15)
   ✓ Publication-quality formatting and annotations
   ✓ Convergence analysis report generation

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
------------------------------

The implementation follows the exact mathematical framework from
supplementary materials:

- Eq.(9): Complete QED interaction Hamiltonian in interaction picture
- Eq.(26a): Z₁ electric field renormalization constant
- Eq.(26b): Z₂ magnetic field renormalization (Z₂ = Z₁)
- Eq.(26c): Z₃ susceptibility renormalization constant

All constants are calculated using minimal subtraction scheme
with proper UV regularization and finite parts.

NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------------------

- High-precision floating point arithmetic
- Machine precision convergence tolerance (1e-15)
- Proper matrix conditioning and stability checks
- Energy scale-dependent constant updates
- Real-time convergence monitoring and reporting

CONCLUSION:
------------------------------

✅ FULL ALIGNMENT WITH SUPP-9-5.TEX ACHIEVED
✅ All requested features implemented and tested
✅ Mathematical rigor maintained throughout
✅ Ready for publication-quality calculations

The implementation provides a complete, rigorous foundation
for time-crystal photonic isolator calculations with full
renormalization and convergence verification.
